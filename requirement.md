Project Overview
Build a modern, visually engaging website for a Brick Factory using Next.js. The site must feature smooth transitions, GSAP-powered animations, slick and elegant design, and cool visual effects. It should create an immersive experience, visually telling the story and process of brick manufacturing, products, and the company. Parallax animations should enhance depth and user engagement.

Objectives
Present the brick factory’s products, process, and brand using visually stunning web animations and interactions

Use modern, responsive design principles; site must look professional and appealing on mobile and desktop

Stand out with sophisticated transitions and GSAP-powered effects

Provide clear navigation and engaging storytelling about the factory, products, history, and team

Technical Requirements
Framework: Next.js (latest stable)

Animations: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for all core page transitions, parallax effects, and subtle animations

Styling: Tailwind CSS (preferred), or CSS-in-JS solution if required

Responsive: Mobile-friendly, optimized for both touch and desktop navigation

Performance: Fast-loading, image and code optimization using Next.js best practices

SEO: Well-structured HTML with appropriate heading tags, alt text on images

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance where reasonable

Core Pages & Sections
Homepage

Animated brick wall or kiln visual, transforming as users scroll (parallax)

GSAP entrance effects for main branding and call to action

Hero section: Tagline, large logo/visual, smooth intro animation

About the Factory

Company history, values, mission

Timeline with animated milestones

Bricks flying in/building visuals as you scroll

Our Process

Step-by-step animated flow: sourcing clay → shaping → firing → quality control → shipping

Parallax animations showing factory machinery, bricks, smoke, conveyor belts

Hover or scroll-triggered micro-interactions

Products

Gallery grid/list of different brick types, with animated hovers

Detail view with GSAP transitions (expanding cards, sliding panels, etc.)

Filters with slick, animated transitions

Projects/Portfolio

Before/after, site usage examples (parallax scrolls showcase completed works)

Animated overlays on hover with project info

Meet the Team

Staff cards with flip or reveal animations

Animated background visuals

Contact Us

Animated form fields, subtle motion to guide user through form

Parallax map or location animation

Design & UX
Slick, industrial yet modern aesthetic: clean lines, minimal color palette with accent colors (brick reds, greys, dark backgrounds)

Smooth transitions between routes and page sections (no jarring jumps)

Cool effects: animated particle dust, kiln glow, brick stacking/unstaking

Navigation: Sticky nav with animated underline/transitions, hamburger for mobile

Parallax: Layered backgrounds and elements move at different speeds on scroll (GSAP + ScrollTrigger), especially on Homepage and Process sections

Micro-interactions: Animations on button hovers, icon clicks, etc.

SVG Animations for logos, machinery, decorative dividers

Animation Details
Use GSAP Timelines for chaining complex sequences

Trigger animations on scroll with GSAP ScrollTrigger

Staggered entrances for content blocks

Elements enter with ease-in-out, bounce, or custom GSAP easings

Subtle movements (e.g. floating particles, glows, shifting textures) throughout the background

Parallax depth for large images and background sections

Content and Imagery
Use high-resolution photos of bricks, factory environment, staff

Illustrate process with SVGs/graphics (animated with GSAP)

Allow for placeholder content if exact images not yet available

Optional Features / Stretch Goals
Virtual brick builder (drag-drop/minigame for users to "build" with bricks)

Animated product configurator (choose brick color/size, real-time update)

Scroll-synced background music, optional toggle

Deliverables
Fully functional Next.js codebase with all the above features implemented

Well-organized project structure and reusable components

Clear README with setup and deployment instructions

All code, images, and assets used, with appropriate licenses
